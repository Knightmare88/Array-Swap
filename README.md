# Array-Swap
Swap the numbers in an array (WIP)

Write a function named reverse that takes the following parameters:

1) size as an int
2) beginIndex as an int
3) endIndex as an int
4) an array of type int

The goal is to create a fungction that swaps the content of an array between beginIndex and endIndex.
e.g. 1, 5, 7, 9, 8, 5 --> 5, 8, 9, 7, 5, 1
     b              e
